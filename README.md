This application implements a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** using the **Value Iteration** algorithm to determine optimal policies for navigating a grid-based environment with rewards and obstacles. It provides a visual interface to display state utilities, policy paths, and dynamic updates based on user-defined goals and constraints. Users can define sources, destinations, and obstacles, adjust transition probabilities, and visualize how the agent learns to find the optimal path.

## ðŸš€ Requirements

- **.NET Framework 4.7.2** or higher  
- **Windows OS** (recommended)  
- **Visual Studio** (for development and code modifications)  
- **C# Compiler** (if building from source)

Ensure that the required .NET Framework is installed to run the application without issues.

## âš¡ Usage

1. **Download the Application:**
   - Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
   - Extract the ZIP file if downloaded.

2. **Run the Application:**
   - Navigate to the extracted folder:
     ```
     MDP/bin/Release/
     ```
   - Double-click on `MDP.exe` to launch the application.

No additional installation is required. The app will open with a user-friendly GUI where you can start visualizing MDP policies right away.

## ðŸ“Š Features

- Interactive grid-based environment
- Customizable start points, goals, and obstacles
- Adjustable transition probabilities for stochastic behavior
- Real-time visualization of value iteration and optimal policies
- Data export for path analysis
